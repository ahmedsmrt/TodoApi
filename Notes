Notes while developing this simple Todo App:
    - First thing i've noticed is that when creating an application using the .Net suite it's easier
    if you use a template or package as a starting point.

    - Second thing i've noticed is that it's important to make sure that when creating an application
    that creates api endpoints and stores data in a database an easy way to do so in a simple project
    is to use the packages for EF(Entity Framework) and EF diagnostic

    - It's also good to know that when breaking down the project structure you need a database.cs file, a program.cs file and a file that models the data managed by the application. I'm assuming this eventually translates into models and controller directories as projects increase in complexity.
